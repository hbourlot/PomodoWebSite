						explore the universe, or got lost somewhere between two
						black holes. ðŸŒŒ
					</p>
					<p>
						But relax, you're not lost in space (yet). You can
						safely go back to the
						<RouterLink href="/"> main page</RouterLink> or{" "}
						<RouterLink href="/history">the history</RouterLink> â€”
						or you can stay here and pretend youâ€™ve found a secret
						page that only the coolest explorers can access. ðŸ§­âœ¨
					</p>
					<p>
						If you think this page should exist (or if youâ€™d like to
						chat about time travel and wormholes), just get in
						touch. Otherwise, use the menu to return to the real
						world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, hereâ€™s something to think about: "If a page
						doesnâ€™t exist on the internet, did it ever really
						exist?" ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
